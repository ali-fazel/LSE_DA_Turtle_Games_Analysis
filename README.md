# LSE_DA_Turtle_Games_Analysis

5 items in this repo: R script, Python script on Jupyter Notebook, Word analysis report, PowerPoint presentation of insights and findings, and a link to Google drive for the mp4 file presentation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yHfPoYe8_VH9wIJMs-hOeXf5q2UcDe-H/view?usp=share_link

Please note in slide 10 of the recorded presentation the wrong graph is displayed but the comments still stand. The graph was replaced in the final presentation with the correct histogram as seen on the PowerPoint file.
